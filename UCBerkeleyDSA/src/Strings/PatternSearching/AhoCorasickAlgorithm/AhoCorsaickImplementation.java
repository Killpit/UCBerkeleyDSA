/*Aho-Corsaick Algorithm finds all words in O(n+m+z) time where z is total number of occurrences of words in text. The
* Aho-Corsaick string matching algorithm formed the basis of the original Unix command fgrep.*/

/*Steps

* Go To :   This function simply follows edges
          of Trie of all words in arr[]. It is
          represented as 2D array g[][] where
          we store next state for current state
          and character.

Failure : This function stores all edges that are
          followed when current character doesn't
          have edge in Trie.  It is represented as
          1D array f[] where we store next state for
          current state.

Output :  Stores indexes of all words that end at
          current state. It is represented as 1D
          array o[] where we store indexes
          of all matching words as a bitmap for
          current state.

Matching : Traverse the given text over built automaton to find all matching words.*/

//Time Complexity: O(n+l+z), where 'n' is the length of the text, 'l' is the length of keywords, and 'z' is the number of
//matches

//can have
