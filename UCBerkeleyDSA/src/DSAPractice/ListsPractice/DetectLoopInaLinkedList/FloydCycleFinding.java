/*
* This algorithm is used to find a loop in a linked list. It uses two pointers, one moving twice as fast as the other
* one. The faster one is called the faster pointer and the other one is called the slow pointer.*/

/*
* Follow the steps below to solve the problem:
* Traverse linked list using two pointers
* Move one pointer (slow_p) by one and another pointer (fast_p) by two
* If these pointers meet at the same node, then there is a loop. If pointers do not meet, then the linked list doesn't
* have a loop*/

//Auxiliary Space: O(1)
