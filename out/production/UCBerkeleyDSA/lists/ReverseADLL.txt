Follow the given steps to solve the problem using the above approach:

-Traverse the linked list using a pointer
-Swap the prev and next pointers for all nodes
-At last, change the head pointer of the doubly linked list

Reverse a Doubly Linked List using Stack:

Push the node's data into the stack while traversing the doubly linked list, then pop out the elements from the
stack and copy the value of the nodes of the linked list by again traversing it

Follow the given steps to solve the problem using the above approach:

-Traverse the whole Linked List and Keep pushing the node's data into the stack
-Then keep popping the elements out of the stack and updating the Doubly Linked List

To reverse a doubly linked list, we can follow the below algorithm:

-Check if the head of the linked list is null or the next node is null. If yes, return the head of the list.
-Initialize three pointers - current pointing to the head of the list, prev to null and next to null.
-Traverse the linked list by moving the current pointer to the next node, and for each node, set its next pointer
to point to the previous node and its prev pointer to point to the next node.
-Once the traversal is complete, set the head of the list to point to the last node of the original linked list
(which is now the first node of the reversed list).
-Return the new head of the list

Algorithmic Steps:

1-Create a function to reverse the linked list, which takes the head node as input.
2-Initialize three pointers: prevNode to NULL, currentNode to the head node, and nextNode to NULL.
3-Traverse the linked list using a while loop until the currentNode pointer is not NULL.
4-Inside the loop, assign nextNode as the next node of the currentNode using the next pointer.
5-Set the next pointer of the currentNode to prevNode, effectively reversing the pointer direction of the
currentNode.
6-Update prevNode to the currentNode.
7-Update currentNode to the nextNode.
8-Finally, set the head node to prevNode and return it.
